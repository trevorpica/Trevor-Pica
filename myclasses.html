    <p1>The classes I am currently in are: AVIT 325, AVIT 327, AVIT 402, AVIT 403, AVIT 407, CSCI 110</p1>
<p>I am currently in my third year here at UND and almost a third way done getting done towards my degree. I am currently in AVIT 325, which is learning how to fly Multi-engine planes. I had no expectations for Aviation coming here to UND and I fell in love with it. I have debated on getting a minor or double majoring in UAS as well. My dream job would be aerial firefighting or becoming a corporate company pilot. </p>
