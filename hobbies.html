<h1>Watching Sports</h1>
<p>I am a avid sports fan like most other people. My favorite sports are: Hockey, Football, and Baseball. My favorite teams are: the Pittsburgh Penguins, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Boston Redsoxs. I have developed my favorite teams from my dad who grew up liking them as well. Thanksgiving of 2019 my family and another family went to spend it in Pittsburgh to attend a Penguins game and a Steelers game. I also like enjoying watching the games (and making friendly bets) with friends and hanging out that way.</p>
