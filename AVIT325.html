<h1>Aviation 325</h1>
<p>Aviation 325 is one of the flight courses needed to be comleted to obtain pilot's Commercial Licesne with getting Instrument Rated and Multi-engine endorsed.I am taking this course with Kent Lovelace, who is the Director of Aviation Industry Relations here at UND. This is a 2 credit course where I have to obtain class Mondays and Wednesday from 1:25 to 3:15 PM. This course also is only 8 weeks long, which means my lass class will be on March 3rd. I am currently flying three times a week with my Multi-engine instructor (MEI), Curtiss Mueller. After finishing this flight course i'll be moving onto Aviation 414, where i'll obtain my Certified Flight Instructor certificate, allowing me to teach students here at UND or anywhere else I may go. </p>
<h2>What we learn in class</h2>
<p>This last Wednesday, we just took our second out of three tests before our final. In the first block we learned about engines, propellers, landing gear, and other airplane basic components. In our last block we were just tested on, we learned about V speeds and Aaerodynamics of a multi-engine airplane. V speeds are speeds designated by the airplane manufactuer to set what the airplane can handle. For example, Vr is a speed at which you rotate the plane from groundroll to takeoff. In our next block we will learn more about Commercial regulations when it comes to flying for hire.</p>
